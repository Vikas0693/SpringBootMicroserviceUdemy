Contains - contains devtools,web,config-client,eureka-client,ribbon(to get urls of currency-exchange-service instances from eureka),openfeign(to make restful calls)
PROJECT README
1)Setting basic rest url invocation using RestTemplate
2)Invocation of REST api through feign to talk to other microservices
3)Added Feign Annotation in Main Class
4)created feign proxy interface named 'CurrencyExchangeServiceProxy' to handle all request to currency-exchange microservice
5)So its easy to handle all calls to particualar microservice at one place or at one interface in our case
6)In @FeignClient we are using uri which is static url.But what if there are three instances of currency-exchange-services are running at same time.We will see how to distribute load among those three services using Ribbon(to dynamically decide url of each service of currency-exchange-service).
7)Why do we need eureka(as naming server) when we have ribbon already - in ribbon config property we have set 'currency-exchange-service.ribbon.listOfServers' to static list of servers but think if we want dynamic scale up/down then we don't want to add them or remove them from listOfServers.Hence we will use Eureka which gives dynamic urls to Ribbon.
8)Eureka naming server is another microservice(can be think of as centralized service) which sends url's of all instances of particular microservice which the calling microservice want.In our case currency-conversion-service will ask for all urls to currency-exchange-service microservices.
9)In Eureka each microservice will register all of its urls which is called service registration.Also when one microservice require all url's to another microservice this process is called service discovery.  
10)Add dependency to eureka for service registration.
11)'eureka.client.service-url.default-zone' in properties will register this microservice with eureka server.
12)We can create as many instances with '-Dserver.port=port' and get it register with eureka automatically, using(11)point above
13)Added exclusion property for jackson.dataformat.xml as netflix-eureka-client uses that which will by default put our responses in xml format.
14)we have commented list of static urls in ribbon-property in app.properties.So from where are we getting url of currency-exchange-service.We are getting that using RibbonClient annotation which has application name as 'currency-exchange-name'.So ribbon goes and ask eureka for url which is related to this application Name.
15)Remember to use rest-controller which has url as 'currency-converter-feign' which uses feign application.name to send request to another microservice.Only this url helps in dynamic scaling as other url has static link to currency-exchange-service.
